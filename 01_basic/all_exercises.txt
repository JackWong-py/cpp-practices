Thatâ€™s a great book to start with! Since youâ€™re in **Part 1** (basics, user interaction, and variables), Iâ€™ll design a set of **20 practice problems** (with difficulty levels) plus **1 mini-project**.

Weâ€™ll focus on:

* Input & output
* Using variables
* Arithmetic
* Basic conditional logic (light intro, since it helps with realistic problems)

## ðŸŸ¢ Normal (10 tasks, ~50%)

1. **Hello User**
   Write a program that asks for the userâ€™s name and then greets them.
   Example: `Hello, Sarah!`

2. **Simple Addition**
   Ask the user for two numbers and print their sum.

3. **Age in Months**
   Ask the user for their age in years and calculate their age in months.

4. **Temperature Conversion**
   Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. Formula: `F = C * 9/5 + 32`.

5. **Simple Multiplication**
   Ask for two integers and print their product.

6. **Area of a Rectangle**
   Input length and width, output area.

7. **Perimeter of a Circle**
   Input radius, output circumference using `2 * 3.14159 * radius`.

8. **Average of Three Numbers**
   Input three numbers, print their average.

9. **Double It**
   Ask for a number, then print it doubled and tripled.

10. **Simple Swap**
    Input two numbers, then swap them (print swapped values).

## ðŸŸ¡ Hard (6 tasks, ~30%)

11. **Unit Converter**
    Ask the user for kilometers, convert to miles (`1 km = 0.621371 miles`).

12. **Grade Percentage**
    Ask for marks obtained and total marks, calculate percentage.

13. **Simple Calculator**
    Ask the user for two numbers and perform **all 4 operations** (add, subtract, multiply, divide).

14. **Compound Interest (Basic)**
    Ask for principal, rate, and time. Compute final amount with simple formula:
    `A = P * (1 + r/100)^t`

15. **BMI Calculator**
    Ask for weight (kg) and height (m), then compute BMI = weight / (heightÂ²).

16. **Currency Exchange**
    Input USD, convert to EUR and JPY (pick some fixed rates).

## ðŸ”´ Extreme (4 tasks, ~20%)

17. **Days to Years/Months/Days**
    Ask for a number of days, convert to years, months, and days (assume 1 year = 365, 1 month = 30).

18. **Reverse Digits**
    Input a 3-digit number, output its digits in reverse order.

19. **Quadratic Equation Solver (Basic)**
    Ask for coefficients a, b, c, compute discriminant `d = bÂ² - 4ac`. Print roots if d â‰¥ 0.

20. **Leap Year Checker**
    Ask for a year, check if itâ€™s a leap year (divisible by 4, not divisible by 100 unless divisible by 400).

## ðŸŽ¯ Mini Project (Mixing All Skills)

**Simple Budget Tracker**

* Ask the user for their monthly income.
* Ask how much they spend in different categories (food, transport, rent, entertainment, savings).
* Output:

  * Total expenses
  * Remaining balance
  * Percentage of income spent vs saved

Extra (if youâ€™re comfortable): Print a warning if expenses > income.

Would you like me to also **provide solutions** (example C++ code) for each exercise so you can compare your attempts, or do you prefer to try first and only check tricky ones later?
